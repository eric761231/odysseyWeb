名與身孰親？
身與貨孰多？
得與亡孰病？
甚愛必大費；多藏必厚亡。
故，知足不辱；知止不殆，可以長久。
——老子．道德經 44 章

Fame or self: Which matters more?
Self or wealth: Which is more precious?
Gain or loss: Which is more painful?

He who is attached to things will suffer much.
He who saves will suffer heavy loss.
A contented man is never disappointed.
He who knows when to stop does not find himself in trouble.
He will stay forever safe.

——Lao Tzu, Tao Te Ching, Chapter 44
