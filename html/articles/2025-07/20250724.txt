人之生也柔弱，其死也堅強；
萬物草木之生也柔脆，其死也枯槁。
故曰：「堅強者，死之徒也！柔弱微細，生之徒也！」
兵強則不勝；木強則折。強大，居下；柔弱，居上。

——老子，道德經 76 章

A man is born gentle and weak.
At his death he is hard and stiff.
Green plants are tender and filled with sap.
At their death they are withered and dry.

Therefore the stiff and unbending is the disciple of death.
The gentle and yielding is the disciple of life.

Thus an army without flexibility never wins a battle.
A tree that is unbending is easily broken.

The hard and strong will fall.
The soft and weak will overcome.

——Lao Tzu, Tao Te Ching, Chapter
76
